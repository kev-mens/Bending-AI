Mixamo, Blender and Unity integration

Notes: 

1. Download character fbx from Mixamo with a tpose stance. Import to unity as main character.

2. Download desired animations in COLLADA (.dae) format for easy modification in blender.

3. When importing .dae into blender, tick "fix leaf bones"  and "find bone chains". Bones will not be connected if left unchecked.

4. After modifying animations, import them as .blend files into blender.
